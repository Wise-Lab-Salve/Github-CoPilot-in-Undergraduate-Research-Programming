# Improving a Data Visualization with Assistance from github coPilot

In this activity, you’ll use your own previously written code to explore how GitHub Copilot can assist in enhancing your data visualization.

1) Please select a current data visualization or plot that you have developed during your research program. You’ll use the code for this plot as the basis for generating a new or improved version with Copilot’s help.

2) If you have a script file (e.g., .py, .R, or .ipynb), drag and drop it into the center panel of Visual Studio Code. You can now copy sections of your code into the VS Code coPilot chat box to generate for help or assistance.

3) Copy the section of your code that generates the plot into the Copilot chat box. Ask Copilot to help you improve the data visualization.

After reviewing Copilot’s suggestions, click the link below to complete a short survey about your experience and the outcome.
