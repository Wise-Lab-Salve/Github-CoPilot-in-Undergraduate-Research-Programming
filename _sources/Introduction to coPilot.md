# Utilizing AI through github coPilot for Undergraduate Research

## A tutorial for introducing and installing github coPilot

## What is github Copilot?

coPilot is like an AI coding partner that helps you write code faster by providing a chatbox for personal assistance and by giving you real-time suggestions as you program. It reads your notes (comments) and existing code to figure out what you might need next.

coPilot will even offer code completion and chat assistance in your coding environment

By using coPilot we aim to see if Undergraduate Researchers can 

1. Write code faster and with less effort 

2. Increase productivity

### What Languages and Environments does Copilot support? 

github coPilot is not supported on some of our common programming apps such as RStudio and Jupyter notebooks. Therefore, we will install a new application called Visual Studio Code to interact with github coPilot. Other supported environments include JavaScript, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, JetBrains suite of IDEs, Azure Data Studio
