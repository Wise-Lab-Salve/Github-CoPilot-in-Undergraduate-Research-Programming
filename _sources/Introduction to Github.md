# Utilizing AI through github coPilot for Undergraduate Research

## A tutorial for installing and setting up github 

## What is GitHub? 


GitHub is a software platform that allows developers and scientists to manage, create, store and share their code. Think of it as the "cloud" for code.

GitHub is honestly one of the most useful tools you can learn as a programmer. It’s popular for sharing code and working on projects with others—whether for school, internships, or your own research. Tons of developers use it, and it's growing, there are over 100 million people using GitHub!

As a student, it is important to remember that
1. GitHub lets you store your code online so you can access it from anywhere.
2. It makes it easy for everyone on a team to see what changes others have made.
3. You can also use it to talk through bugs or ideas with other developers right in the project.
4. GitHub is like portfolio for programmers, even future jobs may look it for recruitment!
