## Why are we investigating github coPilot use in research?


This educational research project investigates the impact of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, on undergraduate students learning and implementation of STEM based programming languages, including R, in an independent research program setting. The goal is to assess whether GitHub Copilot enhances productivity and assists in learning a programming language in a research setting. 

Based on previous research findings in 2,000 programmers that 88% of respondents said they were more productive and that 60-75% of developers reported they were less frustrated when coding, we hypothesize that the use of GitHub Copilot will: 

 
### Increase student productivity in programming tasks. 

### Reduce frustration associated with learning and using programming languages. 

### Support learning of new language-based data visualization techniques 

  

Alternative outcomes include that GitHub Copilot may: 
Lead to an over-reliance on AI assistance for coding  
May provide non-creative solutions to visualizations and overreliance on one graphing type
